  "3": "Once we all lived among these people, fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature, and carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of humanity.",

  "21": "In him the whole building fits together and grows as a temple in the Lord.",
  "22": "It is in him that you also are being built together as a dwelling place for God in the Spirit."
