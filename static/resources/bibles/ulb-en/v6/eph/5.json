    "1": "Therefore be imitators of God, as dearly loved children.",
    "2": "And walk in love, as also Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.",
    "3": "But there must not be even a suggestion among you of sexual immorality or any kind of impurity or of greed, for these are improper for God's holy people.",
    "4": "Let there be no filthiness, no foolish talk, and no crude jokes—all of which are improper. Instead there should be thanksgiving.",
    "5": "For you can be sure of this, that no sexually immoral, impure, or greedy person—that is, an idolater—has any inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.",
    "6": "Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the anger of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience.",
    "7": "Therefore, do not join in with them.",
    "8": "For you were once darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light,",
    "9": "(for the fruit of the light consists in all goodness, righteousness, and truth)",
    "10": "and find out what is pleasing to the Lord.",
    "11": "Do not associate with the unfruitful works of darkness, but rather expose them.",
    "12": "For it is shameful even to mention the things they do in secret.",
    "13": "But when anything is illuminated by the light, it becomes visible.",
    "14": "For anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says,\nand arise from the dead ones,\nand Christ will shine on you.\"\n",
    "15": "Look carefully how you live—not as unwise but as wise.",
    "16": "Redeem the time because the days are evil.",
    "17": "Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.",
    "18": "And do not get drunk with wine, for that leads to reckless behavior. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,",
    "19": "speaking to each other in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with all your heart,",
    "20": "always giving thanks for everything, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to God the Father,",
    "21": "submitting yourselves to one another in reverence for Christ.",
    "22": "Wives, submit to your husbands, as to the Lord.",
    "23": "For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ also is the head of the church, and Christ himself is its savior.",
    "24": "But as the church submits to Christ, so also wives must submit to their husbands in everything.",
    "25": "Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her.",
    "26": "Christ gave himself for the church so that he might make her holy, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,",
    "27": "so that he might present her to himself as glorious, without stain or wrinkle or any such thing, but holy and without fault.",
    "28": "In the same way husbands ought to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself.",
    "29": "For no one ever hated his own body, but nourishes and treats it with care, just as Christ nourishes and treats the church with care,",
    "30": "because we are members of his body.",
    "31": "\"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and will be joined to his wife, and the two will become one flesh.\"",
    "32": "This hidden truth is great—but I am speaking about Christ and the church.",
    "33": "Nevertheless, each of you also must love his own wife as himself, and the wife must respect her husband."
