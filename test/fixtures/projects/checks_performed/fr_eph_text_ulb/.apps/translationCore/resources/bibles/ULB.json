    "3": "Once we all lived among these people, fulfilling the evil desires of our sinful nature, and carrying out the desires of the body and of the mind. We were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of humanity.",

    "12": "For at that time you were separated from Christ. You were foreigners to the people of Israel. You were strangers to the covenants of the promise. You had no certain hope about the future. You were without God in the world.",
    "13": "But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far away from God have been brought near by the blood of Christ.",

    "6": "This hidden truth is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, and fellow members of the body, and they share the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.",
    "7": "For I became a servant of this gospel by the gift of God's grace given to me through the working of his power.",
