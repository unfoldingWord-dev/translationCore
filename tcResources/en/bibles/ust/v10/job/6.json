  "3": "they would be heavier than all the sand along the ocean shores.\\q2 That is why I spoke very rashly about the day that I was born.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "4": "It is as though Almighty God has shot me with arrows.\\q2 It is as though those arrows have poison on their tips, and that poison has gone into my spirit.\n\\q1 The things that God has done to me are like soldiers lined up to attack me.\n\\q1",
  "5": "Just like a wild donkey does not complain by braying when it has plenty of grass to eat,\\q2 and an ox does not complain by bellowing when it has food to eat,\n\\q1 I would not complain if you were really helping me.\n\\q1",
  "6": "People complain when they must eat food that has no salt\\q2 or food that is slimy and tasteless;\n\\q1 that is what your words are like, Eliphaz.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "7": "I do not want to eat food like that,\\q2 because it disgusts me,\n\\q1 and I do not like what you have said to me.\n\\q1",

  "12": "I am not strong like rocks are,\\q2 and my body is not made of bronze.\n\\q1",
  "13": "So I am not able to help myself;\\q2 I am not wise enough for that.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "14": "When a man has many troubles, his friends should be kind to him,\\q2 even if he stops honoring Almighty God.\n\\q1",

  "17": "but when the dry season comes, there is no water flowing in those streams,\\q2 and the channels dry up.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "18": "The caravans of merchants turn off their road to search for water,\\q2 but there is no water in those streambeds,\n\\q2 so the merchants die in the desert.\n\\q1",
  "19": "The men in those caravans searched for some water\\q2 because they were sure that they would find some.\n\\q1",
  "20": "But they did not find any,\\q2 so they were very disappointed.\n\n\n\\q1",

  "28": "Please look at me! I will not lie while I am talking straight to you.\\q1",
  "29": "Stop saying that I have sinned, and stop criticizing me unjustly!\\q2 You should realize that I have not done things that are wrong.\n\\q1",
  "30": "Do you think that I am lying?\\q2 No, I am not lying, because I know what is right to say, and what is wrong.\""
