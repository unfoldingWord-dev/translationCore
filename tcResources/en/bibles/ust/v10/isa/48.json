  "2": "You say that you live in the holy city of Jerusalem\\q2 and you insincerely say that you are relying on the God to whom you people of Israel belong,\n\\q2 the one who is Yahweh, commander of the angel armies.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "3": "\"Long ago I predicted what would happen.\\q2 And then suddenly, I caused those things to happen.\n\\q1",
  "4": "I knew that you people were very stubborn;\\q2 I knew that your heads were as hard as iron or brass.\n\\q1",
  "5": "That is why I told you those things long ago.\\q2 Long before they occurred, I announced that they would occur,\n\\q1 in order that when they happened you could not say\n\\q2 'Our idols did it;\n\\q2 our statue carved out of wood or our idol made of metal caused them to happen.'\n\n\n\\q1",
  "6": "You have heard those things that I predicted,\\q2 and now you have seen that they have all occurred,\n\\q1 so why do you not admit it?\n\\q1 Now I will tell you new things,\n\\q2 things that you have not known previously.\n\\q1",
  "7": "I am causing them to happen now;\\q2 they are not things I did long ago.\n\\q1 So you cannot say, 'We already knew about those things.'\n\n\n\\q1",

  "14": "All of you, gather together and listen to me.\\q2 None of your idols has told this to you:\n\\q1 I, Yahweh, have chosen Cyrus to assist me,\n\\q2 and he will do to Babylon what I want him to do,\n\\q2 and his army will destroy the army of Babylonia.\n\\q1",
