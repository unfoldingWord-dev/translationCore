  "5": "Why do you do things for which Yahweh should punish you?\\q2 Why do you continue to rebel against him?\n\\q1 You are like someone whose\n\\q2 whole mind and heart are sick.\n\\q1",
  "6": "From the bottom of the foot to the top of the head,\\q2 nothing is healthy.\n\\q1 There are open wounds, cuts, and sores\n\\q2 that have not been cleaned or bandaged,\n\\q1 and no one has put oil on them to heal them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "7": "Enemies have ruined your country;\\q2 they have burned your towns, and there is no one left.\n\\q1 Foreigners plunder the crops in your fields while you watch;\n\\q2 they destroy everything that they see.\n\\q1",

  "13": "Stop bringing to me those offerings, because they are useless to me;\\q2 I am disgusted with the incense that the priests burn!\n\\q1 And your feasts to celebrate the new moon each month and your Sabbath days and your other festivalsâ€”\n\\q2 I hate them because of the wicked things that you do!\n\n\n\\q1",
  "14": "I hate all your celebrations of the new moon and the other festivals that you celebrate.\\q2 They are like a heavy burden that I am tired of carrying.\n\\q1",
  "15": "So when you lift up your hands to pray to me,\\q2 I will not look at you.\n\\q1 Even if you pray to me often,\n\\q1 I will not listen to you,\n\\q2 because it is as though your hands are covered with the blood of people whom you have killed.\n\n\n\\q2",

  "22": "Your silver is no longer pure,\\q2 and your wine has become mixed with water.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "23": "Your leaders are rebels;\\q2 they are friends of thieves.\n\\q1 They all want to get money\n\\q2 and make others to give them gifts in order to decide cases in court in their favor.\n\\q1 They do not defend orphans in court,\n\\q2 and they do not help widows to get what they should receive.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "24": "Therefore Yahweh, commander of the angel armies, the mighty God of Israel, says,\\q1 \"I will get revenge against those who are against me,\n\\q2 and avenge myself on my enemies.\n\\q1",

  "26": "After that happens, I will give you good judges like you had in the past.\\q2 You will have wise counselors like you had long ago.\n\\q1 Then people will call your city a city where people act righteously,\n\\q2 a faithful city.\"\n\n\n\\q1",
  "27": "Because the people of Jerusalem will do what is fair,\\q2 Yahweh will restore their city,\n\\q1 and he will save those who repent\n\\q2 because of their righteousness.\n\\q1",
  "28": "But he will crush rebels and sinners,\\q2 and those who forsake him will disappear.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "29": "\"You will be ashamed because you worshiped idols under the oak trees that you thought were sacred,\\q2 and you will be disgraced because you worshiped idols in the gardens that you loved so much.\n\\q1",
  "30": "You will be like a very large tree that has withered leaves,\\q2 like a garden that has dried up because it has no water.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "31": "Those among you who are very strong will become like dry wood,\\q2 and the work they do will be like a spark.\n\\q1 Both they and the evil things that they do will burn up,\n\\q2 and no one will be able to put out the fire.\""
