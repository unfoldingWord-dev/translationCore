  "2": "Think about your ancestor Abraham and his wife Sarah, of whom all of you are descendants.\\q2 When I first spoke to Abraham,\n\\q1 he had no children.\n\\q2 But after I blessed him, he had a huge number of descendants.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "3": "Some day I, Yahweh, will encourage Abraham's descendants again,\\q2 and I will comfort all the people who live in the ruins of Jerusalem.\n\\q1 The deserts in that area will become like Eden;\n\\q2 it will be like the garden of Yahweh.\n\\q1 All the people there will be joyful and happy;\n\\q2 they will thank me and sing.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "4": "My people of Judah, listen carefully to me,\\q2 because I command you to proclaim my laws;\n\\q1 the right things that I will do will be like a light for the people of all the nations.",
  "5": "I will soon rescue you and them;\\q2 by my power I will rule over the people of the earth and bless them.\n\\q1 The people who live in the most distant lands on earth will wait for me to help them.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "6": "Look up at the sky,\\q2 and look at the earth;\n\\q2 see what they are like now,\n\\q1 because some day the sky will disappear like smoke,\n\\q2 and the earth will wear out like old clothes wear out,\n\\q2 and people on the earth will die like flies.\n\\q1 But I will rescue you, and you will remain free forever,\n\\q2 and everyone will know what I do and I will always do what is right.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "7": "You people who know what things are right to do,\\q2 and who know in your inner beings what is written in my laws,\n\\q1 listen to me!\n\\q2 Do not be afraid of people who taunt you;\n\\q2 do not be disturbed when people revile you,\n\\q1",
  "8": "because some day they will be destroyed\\q2 like clothing that moths have eaten,\n\\q1 like wool garments that have been eaten by worms.\n\\q2 Everyone will know what I do and I will always do what is right; \n\\q2 and I will save you, and you will be saved forever.\"\n\n\n\n\\q1",
  "9": "Yahweh, wake up and do something for us!\\q2 Show us how strong you are!\n\\q1 Do mighty things\n\\q2 like you did long ago,\n\\q2 when you stabbed Rahab, the sea monster, and cut it into pieces.\n\\q1",
  "10": "Surely you are the one who dried up the sea,\\q1 and made a path through that deep water\n\\q2 in order that your people could cross it!\n\n\n\\q1",

And that drink made you stagger like you had drunk strong wine. This strong wine represents the anger of God, and you are to drink all of it!\n\\q1",
  "18": "Now you do not have any children \\q1 who are able to take your hand and guide you. You cannot help yourself.\n\n\n\\q1",

  "20": "Your children have fainted and lie at the corner of every street;\\q2 they are as helpless as an antelope that has been caught in a net.\n\\q1 What has happened to them is because Yahweh has been very angry with them;\n\\q2 he has rebuked them severely.\n\n\n\\q1",
  "21": "So now, you people who have suffered much,\\q1 you who were acting as if you were drunk because you were drinking from his cup. \n\\q2 But in truth, it is not because you have drunk out of a cup filled with wine, but because of something else that Yahweh will do. \n\\q1",
  "22": "Yahweh, your Lord and your God,\\q2 the one who argues your case to defend you, he says this:\n\\q1 \"I have away taken that cup that holds my anger toward you, \n\\q1 and I made you experience my anger when I made you drink from that cup. \n\\q1 But now I have taken it from you so that you will never drink of it again. \n\n\n\\q1",
  "23": "Instead, I will cause those who have tormented you to suffer;\\q2 I will severely punish those who said to you,\n\\q2 'Lie down in order that we may walk on you;\n\\q1 lie down on your stomachs\n\\q2 in order that your backs will be like streets that we can walk on.'\""
