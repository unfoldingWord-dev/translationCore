# Ruth #

## Facts: ##

Ruth was a Moabite woman who lived during the time when judges were leading Israel. She married an Israelite man in Moab after he had moved there with his family because of a famine during the time when judges were leading Israel.

* Ruth's husband died, and some time after that she left Moab to travel with her mother-in-law Naomi, who was returning to her hometown, Bethlehem in Israel.
* Ruth was loyal to Naomi and worked hard to provide food for her.
* She also committed herself to serving the one true God of Israel.
* Ruth married an Israelite man named Boaz and gave birth to a son who became the grandfather of King David. Because King David was an ancestor of Jesus Christ so was Ruth.
