## Definition: ##

A "law" is a legal rule that is usually written down and enforced by someone in authority. A "principle" is a guideline for decision-making and behavior.

* Both "law" and "principle" can refer to a general rule or belief that guides a person's behavior.
* This meaning of "law" is different from its meaning in the term "law of Moses," where it refers to commands and instructions that God gave the Israelites.
* When a general law is being referred to, "law" could be translated as "principle" or "general rule."
