# Hebrew, Hebrews #

## Facts: ##

The "Hebrews" were people who were descended from Abraham through the line of Isaac and Jacob. Abraham is the first person in the Bible to be called a "Hebrew."

* The term "Hebrew" also refers to the language that the Hebrew people spoke. The vast majority of the Old Testament was written in the Hebrew language.
* In different places in the Bible, the Hebrews were also called "Jewish people" or "Israelites." It is best to keep all three terms distinct in the text, as long as it is clear that these terms refer to the same people group.
