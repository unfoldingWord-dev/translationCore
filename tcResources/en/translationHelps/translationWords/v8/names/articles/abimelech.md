# Abimelech #

## Facts: ##

Abimelech was a Philistine king over the region of Gerar during the time when Abraham and Isaac were living in the land of Canaan.

* Abraham deceived King Abimelech by telling him that Sarah was his sister rather than his wife.
* Abraham and Abimelech made an agreement regarding ownership of wells at Beersheba.
* Many years later, Isaac also deceived Abimelech and the other men of Gerar by saying that Rebekah was his sister, not his wife.
* King Abimelech rebuked Abraham, and later Isaac, for lying to him.
* Another man by the name of Abimelech was a son of Gideon and a brother of Jotham. Some translations may use a slightly different spelling of his name to make it clear that he is a different person from King Abimelech.
