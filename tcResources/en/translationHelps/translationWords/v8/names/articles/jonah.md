* The book of Jonah tells the story of what happened when God sent Jonah to preach to the people of Nineveh.
* Jonah refused to go to Nineveh and instead got on a ship headed for a Tarshish.
* God caused a huge storm to overwhelm that ship.
* He told the men sailing the ship that he wasrunning away from God, and he suggested that they throw him into the sea. When they did the storm stopped.
