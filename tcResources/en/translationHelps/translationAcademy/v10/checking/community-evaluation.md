# Language Community Evaluation Questions #

We, the members of the translation team, affirm that we have checked the translation with members of the language community.

* We have checked the translation with old people and young people, and with men and women.
* We used the translationQuestions when we checked the translation with the community.
* We corrected the translation to make it clearer and easier to understand in the places where the community members did not understand it well.

Please also answer the following questions. The answers to these questions will help those in the wider Christian community know that the target language community finds the translation to be clear, accurate, and natural.

* List a few passages where the community feedback was helpful. How did you change these passages to make them clearer?

* Write an explanation for some of the Important Terms, explaining how they are equal to terms used in the source language. This will help the checkers understand why you chose these terms.

* Does the community verify that there is a good flow to the language when the passages are read out loud? (Does the language sound like the writer was a person from your own community?)

The community leaders might want to add their own information to this or make a summary statement about how acceptable this translation is to the local community. This can be included as part of the Level Two Community Check Evaluation information. The wider church leadership will have access to this information, and it will help them validate the translation as approved by the local Christian community when they do the Level Two Church Check and also Level Three Checking.
