# Selecting a Platform #

### Recommended Platform

The recommended platform for doing translation in the Door43 ecosystem is translationStudio (http://ufw.io/ts/).  This is where the translation and checking teams will do their work.  You may set up translationStudio on Android, Windows, Mac, or Linux devices, (see [Setting up translationStudio](../setup-ts/01.md) for more information).

### Other Options

If using translationStudio is not an option for your team, then you may consider using other online or offline tools.  Note that it will be your responsibility to get the content into USFM or Markdown format if you do not use translationStudio (see [File Formats](../../translate/file-formats/01.md) for more information).
