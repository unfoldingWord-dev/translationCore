# Setting Up a Translation Team #

### Choosing a Team

As you begin selecting a translation and checking team, there are many different types of people and roles that are needed. There are also specific qualifications that are needed for each team.

* [Choosing a Translation Team](../../translate/choose-team/01.md) - Describes many of the roles that are needed
* [Translator Qualifications](../../translate/qualifications/01.md) - Describes some of the skills needed by the translators
* Remember that everyone on the team needs to sign a statement that they agree with (forms are available at http://ufw.io/forms/ ):
  * [Statement of Faith](../../intro/statement-of-faith/01.md)
  * [Translation Guidelines](../../intro/translation-guidelines/01.md)
  * [Open License](../../intro/open-license/01.md)
* Everyone on the team also needs to know the qualities of a good translation (see [The Qualities of a Good Translation](../../translate/guidelines-intro/01.md)).
* The team will also need to know where they can find answers (see [Finding Answers](../../intro/finding-answers/01.md)).

### Translation Decisions

There are many decisions the translation team will have to make, many of them right at the beginning of the project. Included are the following:

* [Choosing What to Translate](../../translate/translation-difficulty/01.md) - Choosing what to translate first is another decision to be made
* [Choosing a Source Text](../../translate/translate-source-text/01.md) - Choosing a good source text is very important
  * [Copyrights, Licensing, and Source Texts](../../translate/translate-source-licensing/01.md) - Copyright issues must be considered when choosing a source text
  * [Source Texts and Version Numbers](../../translate/translate-source-version/01.md) - Translating from the latest version of a source text is best
* [Alphabet/Orthography](../../translate/translate-alphabet/01.md) - Many languages have alphabet decisions that need to be made
* [Decisions for Writing Your Language](../../translate/writing-decisions/01.md) - Writing style, punctuation, translating names, spelling, and other decisions have to be made
