# The unfoldingWord Project #

The unfoldingWord project exists because we want to see **unrestricted biblical content in every language**.

Jesus commanded his disciples to make disciples of EVERY people group:

>"Jesus came to them and spoke to them and said, 'All authority has been given to me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations. Baptize them into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Teach them to obey all the things that I have commanded you. And see, I am with you always, even to the end of the world.'" (Matthew 28:18-20 ULB)

We have the promise that people from EVERY language will be in heaven:

>"After these things I saw, and behold, there was a great crowd, which no one was able to number, out of every nation, tribe, people, and language, standing before the throne and before the Lamb." (Revelation 7:9 ULB)

Understanding the Word of God in one's heart language is important:

>"So faith comes from hearing, and hearing by the word of Christ." (Romans 10:17 ULB)

### How Do We Do This?

How do we accomplish the goal of **unrestricted biblical content in every language**?

* [unfoldingWord Network](https://unfoldingword.org/network/) - By partnering with other like-minded organizations
* [Statement of Faith](../statement-of-faith/01.md) - By working with those who have the same beliefs
* [Translation Guidelines](../translation-guidelines/01.md) - By using a common translation theory
* [Open License](../open-license/01.md) - By releasing everything we create under an open license
* [Gateway Languages Strategy](../gl-strategy/01.md) - By making Biblical content available to translate from a known language

### What Do We Do?

* **Content** - We create and make available for translation free and unrestricted biblical content. See http://ufw.io/content/ for a complete list of resources and translations. Here are a few samples:

  * **the Bible** - the only inspired, inerrant, sufficient, authoritative Word of God made available under an open license for unrestricted translation, use, and distribution (see http://ufw.io/bible/).
  * **translationNotes** - linguistic, cultural, and exegetical helps for translators. They exist for Open Bible Stories and the Bible (see http://ufw.io/tn/).
  * **translationQuestions** - questions for each chunk of text that translators and checkers can ask to help ensure that their translation is understood correctly. Available for Open Bible Stories and the Bible (see http://ufw.io/tq/).
  * **translationWords** - a list of important Biblical terms with a short explanation, cross references, and translation aids. Useful for Open Bible Stories and the Bible (see http://ufw.io/tw/).

* **Tools** - We create translation, checking, and distribution tools that are free and open-licensed. See http://ufw.io/tools/ for a complete list of tools. Here are a few samples:
  * **Door43** - an online translation platform where people can collaborate on translation and checking, also the content management system for unfoldingWord (see https://door43.org/).
