# Possession #

### Description

In common English, "possession" refers to having something, or to something that a person has. In English that grammatical relationship is shown with <u>of</u>, or an apostrophe and the letter <u>s</u>, or a possessive pronoun.

* the house <u>of</u> my grandfather
* my grandfather<u>'s</u> house
* <u>his</u> house

Possession is used in Hebrew, Greek, and English for a variety of situations. Here are a few common situations that it is used for.

* Ownership - Someone owns something.
  * My clothes - The clothes that I own
* Social relationship - Someone has some kind of social relationship with another.
  * my mother -  the woman who gave birth to me, or the woman who cared for me
  * my teacher - the person who teaches me
* Contents - Something has something in it.
  * a bag of potatoes - a bag that has potatoes in it, or a bag that is full of potatoes
* Part and whole: One thing is part of another.
  * my head - the head that is part of my body
  * the roof of a house - the roof that is part of a house

#### Reasons this is a translation issue

* Translators need to understand the relationship between two ideas represented by the two nouns when one possesses the other.
* Some languages do not use possession for all of the situations that your source text Bible might use it for.

#### Events and Possession

Sometimes one or both of the nouns is an abstract noun that refers to an event or action. In the examples below, the abstract nouns are in **bold** print. These are just some of the relationships that are possible between two nouns when one of them refers to an event.

**Subject** - Sometimes the word after "of" tells who would do the action named by the first noun. In the example below, <u>John baptized people</u>.
>The <u>**baptism** of John</u>, was it from heaven or from men? Answer me." (Mark 11:30)

In the example below, <u>Christ loves us</u>.
>Who will separate us from <u>the **love** of Christ</u>? (Romans 3:35)

**Object** - Sometimes the word after "of" tells who or what something would happen to. In the example below, <u>people love money</u>.
>For <u>the **love** of money</u> is a root of all kinds of evil. (1 Timothy 6:10 ULB)

**Instrument** - Sometimes the word after "of" tells how something would happen. In the example below, God would <u>punish people by sending enemies to attack them with swords</u>.
> then be afraid of the sword, because wrath brings <u>the **punishment** of the sword</u> (Job 19:29 ULB)

**Representation** - In the example below, John was baptizing people who were repenting of their sins. They were being baptized to show that they were repenting. Their <u>baptism represented their repentance</u>.
>As John came, he was baptizing in the wilderness and was preaching <u>a **baptism** of repentance</u> for the forgiveness of sins. (Mark 1:4 ULB)

### Translation Strategies

If possession would be a natural way to show a particular relationship between two nouns, consider using it. If it would be strange or hard to understand, consider these.

1. Use an adjective to show that one describes the other.
1. Use a verb to show how the two are related.
1. If one of the nouns refers to an event, translate it as a verb.
