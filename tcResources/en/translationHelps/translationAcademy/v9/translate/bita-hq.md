# Biblical Imagery - Body Parts and Human Qualities #

### Description

Some images from the Bible involving body parts and human qualities are listed below in alphabetical order. The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.

#### The BODY represents a group of people

> Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. (1 Corinthians 12:27 ULB)

<blockquote>Rather we will speak the truth in love and grow up in all ways into him who is the head, Christ. Christ joins the whole body of believers together—it is held together by every supporting ligament so that the whole body grows and builds itself up in love. (Ephesians 4:15-16 ULB) </blockquote>

In these verses, the body of Christ represents the group of people who follow Christ.


#### The FACE represents someone's presence

>Do you not fear me—this is Yahweh's declaration—or tremble <u>before my face</u>? (Jeremiah 5:22 ULB)

To be before someone's face is to be in their presence, that is, to be with them.

#### The FACE represents someone's attention

> Every man of the house of Israel who takes his idols into his heart, or who puts the stumbling block of his iniquity <u>before his face</u>, and who then comes to a prophet—I, Yahweh, will answer him according to the number of his idols. (Ezekiel 14:4 ULB)

To put something before one's face is to look at it intently or pay attention to it.

> Many <u>seek the face</u> of the ruler, (Proverbs 29:26 ULB)

If someone seeks another person's face, he hopes that the person will pay attention to him.

To hide one's face from someone is to ignore him.

"His hand is not short" means that he is not weak.

#### The HEAD represents the ruler, the one who has authority over others

>God has subjected all things under Christ's feet and has <u>made him the head</u> over all things in the church, which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all things in all ways. (Ephesians 1:22 ULB)


<blockquote>Wives should be subject to their own husbands, as to the Lord. For the husband is <u>the head</u> of the wife, as Christ also is <u>the head</u> of the church, and he is the Savior of the body. (Ephesian 5:22-23 ULB)</blockquote>


#### A MASTER represents anything that motivates someone to act

>No one can serve <u>two masters</u>, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or else he will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and wealth. (Matthew 6:24 ULB)

To serve God is to be motivated by God. To serve money is to be motivated by money.

<blockquote> See, I have sworn <u>by my great name</u>—says Yahweh. <u>My name</u> will no longer be called upon by the mouths of any of the men of Judah in all the land of Egypt…."  (Jeremiah 44:26 ULB) </blockquote>

#### A NAME represents the fame or reputation of a person

>You must no longer profane <u>my holy name</u> with your gifts and your idols. Ezekiel 20:39 (ULB)


To profane God's name is to profane his reputation, that is, to profane how people think about him.

>For I will make <u>my great name</u> holy, which you have profaned among the nations…. Ezekiel 36:23 (ULB)


To make God's name holy is to cause people to to see that God is holy.

>Your servants have come here from a land very far away, because of <u>the name</u> of Yahweh your God. We have heard a report about him and about everything that he did in Egypt (Joshua 9:9 ULB)


The fact that the men said they heard a report about Yahweh shows that "because of the name of Yahweh" means because of Yahweh's reputation.

#### The NOSE represents anger

>Then…the foundations of the world were exposed at your battle cry, Yahweh—at the blast of the breath of <u>your nostrils</u>. (Psalms 18:15 ULB)
