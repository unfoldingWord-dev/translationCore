# Biblical Imagery - Plants #


Some images from the Bible involving plants are listed below in alphabetical order. The word in all capital letters represents an idea. The word does not necessarily appear in every verse that has the image, but the idea that the word represents does.


#### A BRANCH represents a person's descendant

In the examples below, Isaiah wrote about one of Jesse's descendants and Jeremiah wrote about one of David's descendants.
><u>A shoot</u> will sprout from the root of Jesse, and <u>a branch</u> out of his root will bear fruit.

>He will reign as king; he will bring prosperity and carry out justice and righteousness in the land.  (Jeremiah 23:5 ULB)


In Job when it says "his branch will be cut off," it means that he will not have any descendants.

>His roots will be dried up beneath;
>above will <u>his branch be cut off</u>.
>His memory will perish from the earth;
>he will have no name in the street. (Job 18:17 ULB)
