# Hendiadys #


### Description

When a speaker expresses a single idea by using two words that are connected with "and," it is called "hendiadys." In hendiadys, the two words work together. Usually one of the words is the primary idea and the other word further describes the primary one.

>... his own <u>kingdom and glory.</u> (1 Thessalonians 2:12 ULB)

Though "kingdom" and "glory" are both nouns, "glory" actually tells what kind of kingdom it is: it is a **kingdom of glory** or **a glorious kingdom**.

#### Reasons this is a translation issue

* Often hendiadys contains an abstract noun. Some languages may not have a noun with the same meaning.
* Many languages do not use hendiadys, so people may not understand how the two words work together; one word describing the other.

### Examples from the Bible

>... for I will give you <u>words and wisdom ...</u> (Luke 21:15 ULB)

"Words" and "wisdom" are nouns, but in this figure of speech "wisdom" describes "words."

>... if you are willing and obedient ... (Isaiah 1:19 ULB)

"Willing" and "obedient" are adjectives, but "willing" describes "obedient."

### Translation Strategies

If the hendiadys would be natural and give the right meaning in your language, consider using it. If not, here are other options:

1. Substitute the describing noun with an adjective that means the same thing.
1. Substitute the describing noun with a phrase that means the same thing.
1. Substitute the describing adjective with an adverb that means the same thing.
1. Substitute other parts of speech that mean the same thing and show that one word describes the other.
